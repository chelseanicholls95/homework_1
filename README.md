# Homework 1 Code Refactor

## Description
I have made the following changes to the index.html file:
- Changed the title of the webpage to something that identifies the site. 
- Changed all of the non-semantic tags to semantic tags e.g. header, section, main.
- Added comments to describe each section for easy navigation.
- Added an id attribute to the search-engine-optimization section to fix the broken link from the nav bar. 
- Added alt attributes to all images to improve accessibility. Screen readers and braille keyboards should now be able to read all images. 
- Moved the main image from the stylesheet to the html document to ensure best practices are followed. 
- Changed the h2 tag in the footer to a h3 tag to ensure all of the headers are in order. 

I have made the following changes to the style.css file: 
- Changed the ordering in the CSS stylesheet so that it matches the ordering in the HTML document. 
- Added comments to describe each section for easy navigation. 
- Changed the selectors to match the semantic tags used in the HTML document. 
- Condensed declaration blocks with the same properties and values into one declaration.
