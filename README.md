# Homework 1 Code Refactor

## Description

I have made the following changes to the index.html file:

- Changed the title of the webpage to something that identifies the site.
- Changed all of the non-semantic tags to semantic tags e.g. header, section, main.
- Added comments to describe each section for easy navigation.
- Added an id attribute to the search-engine-optimization section to fix the broken link from the nav bar.
- Added alt attributes to all images to improve accessibility. Screen readers and braille keyboards should now be able to read all images.
- Moved the main image from the stylesheet to the html document to ensure best practices are followed.
- Changed the h2 tag in the footer to a h3 tag to ensure all of the headers are in order.

I have made the following changes to the style.css file:

- Changed the ordering in the CSS stylesheet so that it matches the ordering in the HTML document.
- Added comments to describe each section for easy navigation.
- Changed the selectors to match the semantic tags used in the HTML document.
- Condensed declaration blocks with the same properties and values into one declaration.
